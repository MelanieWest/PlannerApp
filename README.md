# PlannerApp
An app that was built to practice creating a link to google calendar.  For now it only lists upcoming events from the user's selected calendar

I followed the instructions that can be found at:  https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/js

Big picture goal is to display a customizable calendar based on user input.  For now, it can read but not write.
